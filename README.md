> Upload an EPUB, receive a **"bi**onic" **EP**UB.

The "bionic" functionality is implemented using [brec](https://github.com/dobrosketchkun/bionic-reading-epub-converter).
If you need a command-line "bionic" converter, use brec. If you don't always have access to a command-line, use hayai.

This project was scrapped together in under ten minutes, but it should be pretty safe.
